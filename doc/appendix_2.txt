Every verb in a sentence has TAM (Tense Aspect and Modality) feature. For row 1 in user csv, we split the inflected verb into two parts.
a) bare form
b) TAM information
In hindi, TAM information sometimes come together and sometimes with separated words.
For e.g: खाया has the bare form खा. या denotes the TAM. Here, the TAM information is attached to the verb.
In खा रहा है, रहा denotes the aspectual information and है denotes the tense. Here, the TAM information is not attached to the verb. Rather two different words denote the TAM.
in खा सकता है, सकता denotes the modality and है denotes the tense. As we are separating the inflected verb into 2 parts, the TAM information will be grouped together.
In Hindi, the verb agrees with the GNP of noun/pronoun/propernoun.
e.g:	लड़का जा रहा है
	लड़की जा रही है
As we keep the GNP information in the respected columns of noun/pronoun/propernoun, we have decided not to keep the agreement information in verb. So we have taken a decision to keep masculine as default gender, singular as default number and third person as default person for TAM.
for e.g:	लड़का जा रहा है
		लड़की जा रही है
		लड़के जा रहे हैं
For all the 3 above, रहा है will be the default TAM.

Note: Check the guideline for how to group the verb and TAM.
For the list of TAM, you can refer to the TAM list file in ~/communicator-tool/dic/tam_mapping.csv
